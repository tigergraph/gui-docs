= Set up SSO with Azure Active Directory
:experimental:

This is a tutorial for configuring SAML-2.0 based Single Sign-on (SSO) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

== Prerequisites

. TigerGraph must be xref:admin-portal:components/nginx.adoc[configured with SSL].
. xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:enabling-user-authentication.adoc[GSQL authentication must be enabled] by changing the password of the GSQL default user.
. An Azure AD Tenant must be granted `Application Administrator` to follow the tutorial.
. An Azure AD Tenant must be granted `Conditional Access Administrator` to take the next step to configure two-factor authentication (2FA).

== Configure Azure AD SSO

. Log in to Azure Active Directory as an admin user: link:https://aad.portal.azure.com/[Azure AAD Portal Login]
. Create a new application by selecting btn:[Enterprise Applications] in the left sidebar menu and clicking btn:[All applications] > btn:[New application] > btn:[Create your own application].
. Enter a name and ensure that you are using a *non-gallery* application.

[start=4]
. In the sidebar for your new application, choose btn:[Single sign-on] under *Manage*, then click the btn:[SAML] button.

[start=5]
. Enter this information in the btn:[Basic SAML Configuration] section. Replace `<tigergraph-machine-hostname>` with your TigerGraph machine hostname.
.. Identifier (Entity ID): `https://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/gsqlserver/gsql/saml/meta`
.. Reply URL: `https://<tigergraph-machine-hostname>:14240/api/auth/saml/acs`
. Go to Section 3: SAML Signing Certificate and click Edit.
. Set the *Signing Option* to "Set SAML Response and Assertion", then click btn:[Save].
. Also in Section 3, click the btn:[Download] link to download the certificate in Base64 format. This will be used to connect to TigerGraph.
. In Section 4, copy the following information for later use to configure SSO in TigerGraph's Admin Portal:
.. Login URL  (TigerGraph calls this the "Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL")
.. Azure AD Identifier  (TigerGraph calls this the Identity Provider Entity Id in TigerGraph)

== Enable single sign-on in TigerGraph

First, use the xref:security/sso.adoc[SSO documentation] to set up SSO in Admin Portal. This is where you will upload the certificate you downloaded from Azure.

Next, follow these steps:

. Enter the Identity Provider's Entity ID and Identity Provider SSO URL you copied in Step 9 of the previous section.
. At the bottom of the screen, for the *Authentication Context* section, use `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:Password`

Before Azure and TigerGraph can successfully communicate, the Azure AD groups need to be correctly mapped to TigerGraph proxy groups with the appropriate roles.
The TigerGraph proxy group is created with the `key=value` proxy rule. The key and value should match the SSO user claims in the SAML response.

For example, you could add a `Name` key with a value of `in_group1` and a `Member` group attribute value of `True` for a certain group, in this example `TestGroup1`.

This will return `in_group1 = True` in the SSO SAML response only if the Azure user is part of TestGroup1.

See Microsoft's official documentation for instructions on setting up the SAML tokens on the Azure side: link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization[Customize Claims issued in the SAML token for enterprise applications]

== Create a TigerGraph proxy group

. In AdminPortal, select btn:[Management] > btn:[Users] from the left sidebar menu.
. At the top of the Users page, select btn:[All Users] and click on btn:[Proxy Group].
. Click the btn:[+ Add Group] button to add a new group.
. Enter a name for your proxy group and use the same attribute name and value from Azure. In this example, the attribute-value pair is `in_group1` and `True`.

[start=5]
. Navigate to the btn:[Role Management] tab at the top.
. Select a graph and role on the graph for the proxy group, then click Save.

. Go to btn:[Users] > btn:[My Profile] and check to see that your profile has the correct role.

== Enable multi-factor authentication

TigerGraph supports multi-factor authentication (also known as MFA or 2FA) once it is enabled in Azure.
