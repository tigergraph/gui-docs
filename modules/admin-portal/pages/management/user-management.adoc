= User Management
:experimental:

The User Management page has three tabs: My Profile, All Users and Role Management.

== My Profile

All users can access the My Profile tab to manage their own credentials.

image::my-profile-updated.png[]

To change your password, click the key icon image:key.png[] in the Password card at the top.

=== Secret Management

Below the cards is the secret management section, where you can create and delete secrets, which are unique strings that can be used to generate authorization tokens.
An alias is required for each secret.

You can create as many secrets for each graph as you want, but remember to copy the secret value and save it at a secure location when you generate a secret.
Once you refresh the page or go to another page and come back, the actual secret value will be masked for security.

With token authentication enabled, use the secrets to request tokens and add the tokens in the HTTP request headers to call TigerGraph REST endpoints.

== All Users

The All Users tab displays information on all users.
Only users with user or proxy groups management permission can access this tab.
Users with user management permissions (`READ_USER` and `WRITE_USER` privileges) can:

* add new users
* change passwords for other users
* delete users

Users with proxy groups management permission (`READ_PROXYGROUP`, `WRITE_PROXYGROUP` privileges) can:

* create proxy groups
* change proxy rules
* delete proxy groups

To see a list of all privileges, see xref:tigergraph-server:reference:list-of-privileges.adoc[List of Privileges].

[NOTE]
====
Both native users and proxy users are displayed in the User section.
However, you can only change the password for native users.

Click btn:[+ Add User] to add new users:

image::all-users (1).png[Add new user pop-up]

Click image:change-others-password-btn.png[] to edit another user's username and password.

Click image:delete_btn.png[] to delete a user.

=== Proxy groups

A proxy group is a way to manage users based on an aspect of their account identity set up as part of SSO or LDAP.
For example, different proxy groups could correspond to different teams, and each team could be granted different access levels to different graphs.

Click the Proxy Group tab at the left under User to see all proxy groups:

image::proxy-groups.png[]

Click btn:[+ Add Group] to add new proxy groups:

image::add-proxy-group.png[]

The attribute name and attribute value are checked against all attributes supplied by an identity provider (IDP) using SSO or LDAP. Please ensure the name and value match exactly with the IDP values.

Click image:edit.png[] to edit the proxy rule of an existing proxy group.

Click image:delete_btn.png[] to delete a proxy group.

Read more about proxy groups at xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:index.adoc[].

== User-defined roles

The _User-defined roles_ tab lists all user-defined roles and allows users with sufficient privileges to create new roles. Users must have the `READ_ROLE` privilege on at least one graph to access this tab. This section describes the procedures to create, edit, and drop roles, as well as assign roles to users in GraphStudio.
To learn more about roles and privileges in TigerGraph's role-based access control system, see xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:index.adoc[].

To create/edit/delete a role, a user must also have the `WRITE_ROLE` privilege on that graph.
See more details in xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:access-control-model.adoc[].

All user-defined roles that you can view appear in a table:

image::user-defined-roles.png[]

Each row shows one role along with the privileges it contains.
For global roles, all privileges on either global level or a specific graph will be listed.

=== Create a user-defined role

Click btn:[+ Create role] at the right upper corner of the "User-defined Roles" tab to create a role.
You can create a global role or a local role on a graph.

A global role can be granted privileges on any graph or globally. A local role is limited to one specific graph.

Select image:global-ratio-btn.png[] to start creating a global role.
Choose global level privileges to assign to this role in the first panel.
Clicking on a privilege grants that role immediately after the box is checked.

image:grant-privileges.png[]

Click  btn:[+ Grant privileges on another graph] at the bottom of the window to create privileges for a different graph.

When you grant local privileges, you have the ability to grant `READ_DATA`, `CREATE_DATA`, and `UPDATE_DATA` privileges at various levels:

* Graph level: Grants access to all data on the graph.
* Vertex or edge level: Grants access to all data on the specified vertices and edges, but not others
* Data level: Grants access to the specified data on the specified vertices and edges, but not other data on those or other vertices or edges.


=== Edit a user-defined role

Click image:edit.png[] to open the privileges menu again for editing.
Deselect a privilege to drop it from the role and select one to add it to the role.

When editing a role, you cannot change a local role to a global role, or vice versa.

=== Drop a role

Click image:delete_btn.png[] to drop a role.

== Role management

In the _Role Management_ tab, users can view the role assignment of users, assign roles to users, and revoke roles from users. Users must have the `READ_ROLE` privilege along with the `READ_USER` or `READ_PROXYGROUP` privilege on at least one graph to access this tab.

[CAUTION]
====
Admin Portal does not indicate whether a user belongs a proxy group. You can find out more from GSQL client.

Admin Portal shows a combination of roles for proxy users.
Proxy user which belongs to a proxy group inherits all the roles from the proxy group plus all the roles the proxy user has.
Therefore, if you want to revoke a role from a proxy user, you need to revoke the role from the proxy group first.
Then you might need to revoke the same role from the proxy user if the proxy user also has that role.
====

A user needs to have the `WRITE_ROLE` privilege to assign roles via Admin Portal.
If you only have the `READ_ROLE` privilege, you can view the current assignment but cannot modify it.

image::role-management.png[]

=== Select a graph

You can use the dropdown menu in the top left corner to select on which graph you want to assign different roles to different users.
Choose `global` to assign global roles or a specific graph to assign local roles.

=== Select a role

You can use the second dropdown menu to select a previously-defined role that you want to assign to different users.

NOTE: With `global` selected, you can assign all global built-in or user-defined roles.
With a specific graph selected, you can assign all local built-in roles or local user-defined roles within that graph.

=== View role details

Next to the dropdowns, click the btn:[View role details] button to view the information on the selected role.

image::role-detail.png[]

=== Settings for user view

In the Settings dropdown, you can sort the users in alphabetic order or by name length.

You can also choose to show all users, show the users who have the role, or show only the users who don't have the role.


=== Grant/revoke a role

NOTE: On a small screen, you need to click btn:[Manage] to open the assignment panel.

Once you've selected a graph and a role, all users will be listed with a checkbox. You can check the box next to the user to grant the role, or uncheck to revoke the role.

image::user-assignment.png[]

After modifying your assignment, click btn:[SAVE] to save your changes.
You can also discard your changes with the btn:[DISCARD] button.

Click the proxy group button to switch to proxy groups and manage their roles.

If you have made changes to users through GSQL after opening the user management page, click the refresh button in the top right corner to reflect the changes in Admin Portal.
