:description: The Nginx configuration page.
:experimental:

You can configure Nginx settings on menu:Admin Portal[Management > Security > Nginx] page.
Configurable settings include:

* SSL configuration
* Allowed CIDR list (whitelist IP)
* Response header.

== Allowed CIDR list

The `Allowed CIDR list` field configures the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing[CIDR] list that are allowed to access Nginx.
The value for this field is a list of CIDR blocks separated by `,` commas.

By default, there are two CIDR blocks on the list: `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0`, for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
The default settings allow anyone with access to the Nginx port to access Nginx.

You can modify the allowed CIDR list to only allow hosts from a specific CIDR block to access Nginx.
A CIDR block looks like a normal IP address except that it ends with a slash followed by a number, called the IP network prefix.
A network prefix is an aggregation of IP addresses.


For example, 192.50.128.0/16 defines the first 16 bits of the IP address to identify the address aggregation.
It includes every address from 192.50.0.0 to 192.50.255.255.
If you put 192.50.128.0/16 in the allowed CIDR list, then every host with an IP address from 192.50.0.0 to 192.50.255.255 are allowed to access Nginx.

[CAUTION]
====
If you decide to change the allowlist, you should at least make sure that you allow requests from your own instance:

* If you are running a single-server instance, 127.0.0.1 should be included in the allowed CIDR block.
An easy way to do this is to add 127.0.0.1/32 to the end of your allowed list.
* If you are running a cluster, you can run `gssh` in the Linux terminal to find out the IP addresses of all machines in your cluster.
Make sure the allowed CIDR block you provide includes the IP address of every machine.
====

If you are unsure which CIDR block you want to allow, you can use link:https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr[an online tool] to calculate the corresponding CIDR block for an IP range or vice versa.

== Response header

The `response header` can be empty.
In addition, you can also add one by clicking the + on the right side of the `response header` box, or you can delete the specified one by clicking-on the right side of a `response header`.

== SSL for Nginx

image::ssl-for-nginx.png[]

SSL certificate:: An SSL certificate is a data file hosted in a website's origin server. SSL certificates make SSL/TLS encryption possible, and they contain the website's public key and the website's identity, along with related information.

SSL key:: The private key used for SSL.

You can provide the SSL certificate and SSL key in one of the following ways:

* Uploading files.
 ** Click the btn:[file upload] button next to the input box, and a drop-down menu for uploading files will appear. Click the btn:[Upload file] option to upload the desired file.
* Providing manual input to self-sign.
 ** Click the btn:[file upload] button next to the input box, and a drop-down menu for uploading files will appear.
Click btn:[Self Signed] to fill in the information to generate a self-signed certificate.
*A self-signed certificate will be valid for a year*.

Since configuration change requires restarting the server service, a pop-up box will appear to confirm whether to restart the service.
After clicking the btn:[OK] button, the configuration changes and server restart process will take several moments.
You will be notified after all the process is completed.

[WARNING]
====
Downgrading from HTTPS to HTTP (turning off SSL) will cause a user authentication failure.

If you are seeing an authentication failure after turning off SSL in Chrome, clear the cache from Chrome and refresh the browser.
