= Visual Query Builder

== Overview

In TigerGraph 3.0, we are proudly introducing _Visual Query Builder_ -- a visual way of building your graph business logic. In the Build Graph Patterns page, you can create visual patterns in drag-and-drop fashion, which intuitively represent the questions you want to ask. For these cases, you don't need to write GSQL anymore!

By adding the Visual Query Builder component, GraphStudio becomes a complete visual SDK for users to _build graph applications from end to end without writing a single line of code_!

image::assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvxajkx4smjvf9mef0w_-lvxaqyvgcsc9ptnpdht_vqb-overview.png[]

Currently, Visual Query Builder is still in beta phase. Please expect lots of improvements and changes coming in the future!

=== Basic Concepts

A visual pattern is a declarative way of describing a template subgraph structure, and all the subgraph structures that the visual pattern is *homomorphic* with are valid matching results.

Visual patterns are constructed by vertex patterns, edge patterns and widgets.

This is a basic vertex pattern within a visual pattern:

image::vertex-pattern-basic.png[]

This is a vertex pattern with 2 filters, 1 attachment, 2 ordering, and limit:

image::vertex-pattern-full_3.3.png[]

This is a vertex pattern that will be output in the pattern execution result. You can see the glow around the border and the highlight at the label:

image::vertex-pattern-full-output_3.3.png[]

This is a basic edge pattern:

image::edge-pattern-basic.png[]

This is an edge pattern with 1 filter:

image::edge-pattern-filter.png[]

This is an edge pattern that will be output in the pattern execution result:

image::edge-pattern-filter-output.png[]

This is a union widget:

image::widget.png[]

A widget has input vertex patterns and output vertex patterns:

image::intput-output.png[]

This is the visual pattern matching all the people who are younger than 30 years old in the year 2019. The filter *((2019 - birthYear) < 30)* on the person vertex pattern provides the matching condition:

image::demo_1.png[]

This is the visual pattern matching all the departments having at least one male employee:

image::demo_2.png[]

This is the visual pattern that matches the hometown of the most people having the programming skill. The attachment *COUNT(DISTINCT p) as cnt* annotates the number of people born in each city that have the programming skill. Then we order the city vertices *by their descending cnt value*, and choose the top 1 city:

image::demo_3_3.3.png[]

This is the visual pattern matching all such three persons A, B and C, where A is B's friend, and A is C's friend, and B is C's manager:

image::demo_4.png[]

This visual pattern matches all the people that born in Redwood City and attended Stanford university, but didn't work for Google:

image::demo_5.png[]

Now you have a first sight about how the visual patterns look like. Let's walk through all the concepts in depth.

=== Working Panel

Working panel is the central component (both visually and logically) of Visual Query Builder. Your visual patterns are rendered here.

Like other pages in GraphStudio, you can zoom-in, zoom-out and drag the visual pattern. If you have unsaved changes to the pattern, or containing errors in the pattern, some warning messages will show at the top left corner of working panel:

image::pattern-working-panel.png[]

If you click the message indicating errors, the Console will switch to Problems tab:

image::pattern-errors.png[]

You can click the error messages. For some errors, the vertex patterns, edge patterns and widgets involved in the error will be marked red to facilitate your debugging:

image::pattern-highlight-error.png[]

=== Pattern List

The pattern list panel contains three sections:

==== Graph patterns

The graph patterns section lists all the visual patterns you have
created for current graph. You can
click image:upload_file_btn.png[image] to create
new patterns, or
click image:delete_forever.png[image] to delete
existing ones.

image:pattern-list.png[image]

== Description

Other than the visual view of the graph pattern, you can optionally add
a description for the pattern. This can help other users to understand
what problem you are trying to solve.

image:https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LHvjxIN4__6bA0T-QmU%2F-LvhRxsMmFzrFtib487V%2F-LvhZjOAREmlJ_qwVZDm%2Fpattern-description.png?alt=media&token=ba475672-ba6b-4038-9237-64eb23a53744[image]‌

After changing the description, don't forget to confirm the change:

image:https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LHvjxIN4__6bA0T-QmU%2F-LvhRxsMmFzrFtib487V%2F-LvhaA47rYs2QvIMAqCo%2Fconfirm-or-cancel.png?alt=media&token=1f8730cb-f29e-4513-bb45-c01766d441af[image]

Changing description is considered as a change to the visual pattern,
don't forget to save the pattern in the end.

== Pattern parameters

If you added some parameters in your visual pattern, you need to provide
the values to the parameters when running the pattern.

image::pattern-params.png[image]

Click image:run-pattern.png[image] to run the pattern.

== Toolbar

The toolbar options, from left to right, are the following:

[width="100%",cols="^50%,<50%",options="header",]

|===

== Configuration Panel

You can edit vertex patterns and edge patterns from config panel.

=== Basic Info for vertex pattern
If you enter editing mode of a vertex pattern and expand the Basic Info section, you can edit its name, decide whether or not to put it into result, change
its vertex type, provide optional matching conditions by giving a list
of ids, or provide a parameter name.

image:https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LHvjxIN4__6bA0T-QmU%2F-LvmDJHsFycWDzKKRvbn%2F-LvmGGM22Jxkwmy-OkHN%2Fvertex-pattern-basic.png?alt=media&token=5d964b95-5799-486c-bbd4-1eea486b0c57[image]‌
You can add/drop id in the list:

image:https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LHvjxIN4__6bA0T-QmU%2F-LvmDJHsFycWDzKKRvbn%2F-LvmGsiKMygJOaG6YRQc%2Fvertex-pattern-ids.png?alt=media&token=9c0058e1-f5b5-412f-88f8-b85b19de5954[image]‌
Or add an input parameter:

image:https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LHvjxIN4__6bA0T-QmU%2F-LvmDJHsFycWDzKKRvbn%2F-LvmH-0jZmTfwDdc1CWP%2Fvertex-pattern-param.png?alt=media&token=e0562257-0fd7-41fd-adfb-0f30990d2637[image]‌

=== Basic Info for edge pattern

If you enter editing mode of an edge pattern and expand the Basic Info section,
you can edit its name, decide whether or not to put it into result, or
change its edge type. You can also specify this edge pattern as a regex match by providing Repeat as least (a non-negative integer) and Repeat at most (a positive integer). Due to current GSQL limitations, if you decide to change these numbers, you cannot give the edge pattern a name
or put it into result.

image:https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LHvjxIN4__6bA0T-QmU%2F-LvmDJHsFycWDzKKRvbn%2F-LvmHQxr7mWLpATC0XL3%2Fedge-pattern-basic-info.png?alt=media&token=8ae1fec9-4b76-465e-ba7d-5bc5632e2865[image]‌

When finished editing, you need to confirm the change. You can also
cancel the change if you made a mistake:

image::basic-info-banner.png[image]

NOTE: If you want another vertex pattern or edge pattern to refer to current selected vertex or edge pattern's attributes, you need to give it a name.

=== Filter

If you expand the Filter section, you can add/edit/delete filters for
the selected vertex or edge pattern:

image:non-edit-filter.png[image]

Click image:edit.png[image] besides the filter
expression and enter editing mode of the filter:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvmjvt2mkzujjj4alns_-lvml2ar64-j4_zuavzr_filters.png[image]

You can add multiple filters for each vertex and edge pattern, and they are AND relationship when executing the pattern. Building the filter is similar with building attribute filter in
xref:explore-graph/search-for-vertices.adoc[Explore
Graph page].

One thing special here is that you can refer to attributes on other vertex patterns and edge patterns. Choose *Attribute of vertex or edge* as expression type, then choose the name of the vertex or edge
pattern whose attribute you want to refer to (see above why we need give a name to vertex or edge patterns), then choose the attribute you want to refer to.

image:filter-remote-attr.png[image]

When finished editing, you need confirm or cancel the change:

image:confirm-filter.png[image]

=== Attachment

If you expand the Attachment section, you can add/edit/delete
attachments for the selected vertex pattern (attachment on edge
patterns is not supported):

image:att-non-edit-mode.png[image]

Click image:edit.png[image] beside one
attachment and enter editing mode for the attachment. You can edit
both the attachment expression and attachment name:

image:att-edit-mode.png[image]

When finished editing, you need to confirm or cancel the change:

image:att-confirm.png[image]

In attachments, you can either attach a single value or attach the results of an aggregation function,
to all the matched vertex entity results.

Attaching a single value means attaching the given value to all vertex entities within the matched result.
If for example, you choose to attach the integer value 1, then that value will be attached to all the matched
vertex entity results where the attachment was applied to. If the attachment is applied to an entity that is 
involved in multiple matches, then the attached value is non-deterministic.

Attaching the results of an aggregation function means grouping all the matching
results by the vertex entity which match the vertex pattern, and then
aggregated based on the expression. 

Take this example:

image:att_examples.png[image]

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|===
|name |attachment expression |explanation
|singleValueInt |1 |Attach the integer number `1` to each matched city vertex.

|singleValueReal |1.5 |Attach the real number `1.5` to each matched city vertex.

|singleValueString |"singleValueString" |Attach the string "singleValueString" to
each matched city vertex.

|singleValueBool |true |Attach the boolean value `true` to each matched city vertex.

|singleValueDatetime |2021-01-01 |Attach the datetime value `2021-01-01` to each
matched city vertex.

|singleValueVertex |p |Attach one of the vertex ids of the matched vertices p to the matched 
city vertex connected to vertices p.

|singleValueEdge |b |Attach one of the edge ids of the matched edges b_i to the matched 
city vertex with edges b.

|singleValueAttribute |name |Attach the attribute name of the matched city vertex to
the matched city vertex itself.

|singleValueAttributeOfVertexOrEdge |p.name |Attach one of the `name` attribute of the matched 
vertices p to the matched city vertex connected to vertices p.

|countP |COUNT(DISTINCT p) |Count number of distinct person vertices
matched to each city vertex.

|countMatched |COUNT(*) |Count number of matches each city vertex
involves in.

|sumPHeight |SUM(p.height) |Sum the height attribute of all person
vertices matched to each city vertex.

|minPBirthyear |MIN(p.birthYear) |Get the minimal height attribute of
all person vertices matched to each city vertex.

|maxPBirthyear |MAX(p.birthYear) |Get the maximal height attribute of
all person vertices matched to each city vertex.

|avgPBirthyear |AVG(p.birthYear) |Get the average value of height
attribute of all person vertices matched to each city vertex.

|collectP |COLLECT(p) |Collect all person vertices matched to each city vertex.

|collectPMarried |COLLECT(DISTINCT p.married) |Collect all distinct person vertices' married status matched to each
city vertex.

|avgPAge |AVG((2021 - p.birthYear)) |Calculate the average age of all person
vertices matched to each city vertex.
|===

Consider we have the following matching result:

image:att_results.png[image]

We have the following attachment result table for city vertex _san jose_:

[width="100%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",options="header",]
|===
|city vertex |attachment result |explanation
|san jose |singleValueInt = 1 |Just attach the integer number `1` on the matched city vertex.

|san jose |singleValueReal = 1.5 |Just attach the real number `1.5` on the matched city vertex.

|san jose |singleValueString = singleValueString |Just attach the string value "singleValueString"
on the matched city vertex.

|san jose |singleValueBool = true |Just attach the boolean value `true` on the matched city vertex.

|san jose |singleValueDatetime = ["2020-01-01 00:00:00"] |Just attach the datetime value `2020-01-01` 
on the matched city vertex.

|san jose |singleValueVertex = ["Emily"] OR singleValueVertex = ["Kevin"] |There are two person vertices connected to city vertex _san jose_

              "to_type": "city"
            }
        ] 
        OR 
        singleValueEdge = [
            {
              "attributes": {
                "birthday": "1992-05-23 00:00:00"

              "to_type": "city"
            }
        ] | The city vertex _san jose_ is connected to two born in edges, one of them connects the _san jose_ vertex 
          to the person vertex "Kevin" and the second edge connects the _san jose_ vertex to the person vertex "Emily". 
          The resulting value stored in singleValueEdge is non deterministic and could be either one of these edges.

|san jose |singleValueAttribute = redwood city | The city vertex _san jose_ has the attribute `name` and the value of that 
 is attribute is attached to the _san jose_ vertex.

|san jose |singleValueAttributeOfVertexOrEdge = Emily 
OR 
singleValueAttributeOfVertexOrEdge = Kevin | The city vertex _san jose_ is connected to two person vertices, 
one of them has the attribute `name` = "Emily" and the other has the attribute `name` = "Kevin". The resulting value stored in 
singleValueAttributeOfVertexOrEdge is non deterministic and could be either "Emily" or "Kevin".

|===

As you can see above the values of attaching a single value for `datetime`, `vertex` and `edge` are stored in a list. This is because,
we currently do not have an accumulator to store these data types directly yet.

The data types supported for single value attachments are: `integer`, `real`, `string`, `bool`, `datetime`, `vertex` and `edge`.

=== Order

If you expand the Order section, you can add/edit/delete ordering for
the selected vertex pattern (ordering on edge patterns is not
supported):

image:order-section.png[image]

Click image:edit.png[image] beside the ordering
and enter editing mode for the ordering. You can edit both the ordering
expression and whether results are in ascending or descending order:

image:edit-order.png[image]

When finished editing, you need to confirm the change:

image:confirm-order.png[image]

You can refer to attachments in ordering expression. You can add
multiple orderings, which follow the multi-key ordering rule (upper
ordering dominates). We support ordering by data of types: `integer`,
`real`, `string` and `datetime`. However, single value attachments with
the type `datetime` are stored in a list, thus, we currently do not 
support ordering based on single value attachments that have the `datetime`
data type.

=== Limit

If you only want a subset of your matching result, you can use limit.
Only the top limit results will be returned based on your ordering
settings. If you don't have orderings, the result will be randomly
picked from all matchings.

If you expand the Limit section, you can add/edit/delete limit for the
selected vertex pattern (limit on edge patterns is not supported):

image:limit-section.png[image]

Toggle *use limit* checkbox to enable/disable limit. You can also edit
the limit number:

image:use-limit.png[image]

When finished editing, you need confirm or cancel the change:

image:limit-confirm.png[image]

== Console

The Console panel shows the graph schema, the result of the last pattern execution result, and errors the visual pattern has. Each execution of a pattern generates two types of results: a visualized graph and JSON
text. On the left is a toolbar with buttons for switching between the
tabs. The buttons, from top to bottom, are the following:

[cols="^,<",options="header",]
|===
|menu option |functionality
| image:expand_panel.png[image] 
|Expand/Collapse: expand or collapse the Console panel.

| image:schema (1).png[image]
|Graph schema: show the graph schema.

| image:visual-result (1).png[image]
|Visualize graph result: show the visual result of the last run pattern.

| image:json-result.png[image]  |View JSON
result: show the raw text result in JSON format of the last run pattern.

| image:problems.png[image]  |Problems: show the
errors in the visual pattern.
|===

[[graph-schema-]]
=== Graph schema

Viewing graph schema makes it more convenient for developers to refer to
the schema topology logic and easier to construct the visual pattern.

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvm9pfm2-2ozgm2sd9_-lvmcthyogmsp0kft32s_graph-schema.png[image]

=== Visualize graph result

If the pattern execution result contains a graph structure, the result
will be visualized in this panel as a graph. The panel is the same as
the
xref:explore-graph/graph-exploration-panel.adoc[Explore
Graph panel]. The only difference is that each time you run a pattern,
the previous result will be erased. In Explore Graph, the results are
added incrementally.

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvm9pfm2-2ozgm2sd9_-lvmcxuo-u1fkbkapquo_visual-graph.png[image]

You can switch to the JSON Result panel to see the result in JSON
format.

=== View JSON result

You can see the JSON response of running the visual pattern from this
tab:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvm9pfm2-2ozgm2sd9_-lvmcnniabkll3klmwxr_json-result-vqb.png[image]

[[problems-]]
=== Problems

If the visual pattern contains errors, you can see them here and debug:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvm0wj98fiup0wogjez_-lvm3eb9dlldguwxg6rb_pattern-errors.png[image]

== Save as 

The 'Save as' feature allows users to save the current pattern as a new pattern under a new name.
After clicking the 'Save as' button the user will be asked to input a unique name for the new pattern.
Then, the user will be redirected to the new pattern, and the pattern the user saved as the new pattern will
return to its last saved state.

For example let us say that the user saves the following pattern: 

image:save-as_current-pattern.png[image]

The user then continues to make changes and then decides to save this pattern as a new pattern with a new name,
and clicks on the 'Save as' button.

image:save-as_pattern-with-changes.png[image]

Here is the dialog that prompts the user to enter a name for the new pattern: 

image:save-as_input-dialog.png[image]

After entering the name the user gets redirected to the new pattern:

image:save-as_new-pattern.png[image]

Here is the previous pattern returned to its last saved state:

image:save-as_last-saved-state.png[image]

The new pattern contains all the history (can undo and redo) of the previous pattern, whilst the previous pattern 
loses its history. This imitates the behaviour of most text editors.


== Save as GSQL query

You can view the GSQL query generated from your visual pattern and save
it. Then you can access this query from Write Queries page, modify your
query, interpret it, install it and run it.

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvm4puugyvb92xsngac_-lvm8fwfp4w1f68fzcz-_save-gsql-query.png[image]

== Render pattern options

There are three different rendering options.

image:render-options.png[image]

By default, Pattern detail and Output glow are checked. All the filters, attachments, ordering conditions and limits are rendered, and the
vertex and edge patterns that will be in result will be highlighted with
glow:

image:render-detail_3.3.png[image]

If Pattern detail is not checked, add-on marks will indicate that there are filters, attachments, ordering conditions and limits on
corresponding vertex patterns and edge patterns:

image:render-addon.png[image]

If Pattern add-on is not checked, the add-ons will be hidden:

image:render-no-addon.png[image]

If Output glow is not checked, the output indicating glow is hidden:

image:render-no-glow.png[image]

== Add a vertex pattern

Click image:add_vertex_type.png[image] , and a
new vertex pattern will be added to the visual pattern. You are in the
editing mode of the newly added vertex pattern.

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvvuteg9eqbxemig3sx_-lvvxrsv4oqboqfdo5rn_add-1st-vertex-pattern.png[image]

== Add an edge pattern

Click image:add_edge_type.png[image] , then click
the source vertex pattern of the edge pattern:

image:click-person-vp.png[image]

Then click the target vertex pattern of the edge pattern. A new edge
pattern will be added to the visual pattern. You are in the editing mode of the newly added edge pattern:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvvuteg9eqbxemig3sx_-lvwcirpqnzwxjjmibcm_click-dep-vp.png[image]

== Pick

Pick is a fast way to build your visual pattern. You can pick from
either graph schema or visual result.

Click image:pick-btn.png[image] , then click one
vertex type in the graph schema tab:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvr5x32viax2_hmvxxm_-lvrfke7dyvs6rwkzzbk_pick-vertex-type.png[image]

A vertex pattern will be added to the visual pattern:

image:pick-vertex-type-done.png[image]

Click image:pick-btn.png[image], then click one
edge type in the graph schema tab:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvr5x32viax2_hmvxxm_-lvrfnuttlpzrlvgsfrq_pick-edge-type.png[image]

An edge pattern together with two vertex patterns will be added to the
visual pattern:

image:pick-edge-type-done.png[image]

Click image:pick-btn.png[image] , then click one
vertex in the visualize graph result tab:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvr5x32viax2_hmvxxm_-lvrg-j4xoq7sv1zdjfl_pick-vertex.png[image]

A vertex pattern will be added to the visual pattern. Note that the
vertex pattern contains an id condition because it is picked from an
actual vertex entity from the graph:

== Merge

You can merge multiple vertex patterns of the same vertex type into one vertex pattern.

Hold Shift key to select multiple vertex patterns:

image:multi-sel-vertex-pattern.png[image]

Then click image:merge-btn.png[image] , and you
will get a larger visual pattern:

image:merged-vertex-pattern.png[image]

Use pick and merge together and you can create a complicated visual
pattern quickly.

== Widget

As described in the
link:#_basic_concepts[Basic Concepts], a visual pattern represents a graph pattern matching problem. In graph theory, graph pattern matching is declarative. However, graph pattern matching is not the full story. In a lot of cases you need to represent procedural computation flow. That's why we are introducing widgets.

=== Intersect

Click  image:intersect.png[image] , then click two
vertex patterns of the same vertex type:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvrllqdvwlhlo9elct4_-lvrry_spqmnsq2be_hq_intersect-input1.png[image]

And an intersection widget is added to the visual pattern:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvrllqdvwlhlo9elct4_-lvrs99vsvjblisgtg4w_intersect-added.png[image]

The output vertex pattern means matching all company vertices located at redwood city, *and* belongs to big data industry.

The output company vertex pattern can be part of another larger pattern. You can think of the input vertex patterns of the widget as constraints of the output vertex pattern.

=== Union

Click image:union.png[image] , then click two
vertex patterns of the same vertex type. A union widget is added to the visual pattern:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvrllqdvwlhlo9elct4_-lvrttcpkwcfix_ui3ji_union-pattern.png[image]

The output vertex pattern means matching all company vertices located at redwood city, *or* belongs to big data industry.

=== Subtract

Click image:subtract.png[image] , then click two
vertex patterns of the same vertex type. A subtract widget is added to
the visual pattern:

image:assets_-lhvjxin4__6ba0t-qmu_-lvrllqdvwlhlo9elct4_-lvrtjgenpxrpc6qn91e_subtract-pattern.png[image]

The output vertex pattern means matching all company vertices located at redwood city, *but not* belong to big data industry.

== Downward import

We now support importing visual patterns from a higher version to a lower version.

Here is an example of the dialog that will be shown when an imported solution contains visual patterns which contain features
that are unsupported in the current version: 

image:downward-import-error-dialog.png[image]

Users can choose to either ignore the message and keep the pattern or delete it. If the user chooses to ignore the message and keep
the pattern, the pattern will not be deleted, but it will not be displayed or accessible to the users.

== Next Step

Now you have a basic idea about all different functionalities of Visual Query Builder. Let's go to the next page to walk through how to build some visual patterns to solve your business questions!
